# 🧠 CodePilot – Regex Explainer Module

**CodePilot** is a modular developer utility app built during my Dev Surge bootcamp. This project demonstrates my ability to build full-stack applications using Python, Flask, HTML, and GPT integration (real or simulated).

---

## 🔍 What It Does

The first working module, **Regex Explainer**, allows users to input any regular expression and receive a plain-English explanation.

Currently, the system uses a **simulated GPT response** to save OpenAI quota during development — but it is fully API-ready.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 3.11
- Flask
- HTML/CSS (basic)
- OpenAI API (optional)
- dotenv

---

## 🚀 Features

- Input form for user-submitted regex
- Backend route handling with Flask
- Dynamic explanation rendering
- Modular structure ready for future tools (Bug Fixer, API Tester, etc.)
- Can be upgraded to real-time GPT with a single line of code
